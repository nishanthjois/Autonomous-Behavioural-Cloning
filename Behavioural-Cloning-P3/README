Use Deep Learning to Clone Driving Behaviour

Steps used in the project:

1. Used data (images and corresponding steering angle) provided by Udacity as input.
2. Input images were augmented to simulate the behaviour of car being at different positions.
3. Python generators were used to generate batches of augmented images (as input to model)
4. Convolution neural network (similar to Nvidia's model) in Keras was built to predict steering angles from images.
5. Dropout (to avoid overfitting), he_normal (initialization), ELU (activation) and Adam (optimizer) were used in creation        of model. 
6. Keras model was trained and validated with a training and validation set using checkpoints and early stopping.
7. Saved the weights (.h5) and model (.json)
8. Tweaked drive.py file to take cropped image as input (same size as model's input).
9. Ran the car around track one and it successfully ran without leaving the road (Simulator: Fastest, throttle = 0.2)
